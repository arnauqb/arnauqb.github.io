Hello! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Oxford. I'm also a (research fellow)[https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/people/arnau-quera-bofarull/] at the Institute for New Economic Thinking and a research affiliate at MIT media lab.

My background is mainly in theoretical physics; I read Physics and Mathematics at the University of Barcelona, followed by an MSc in Physics at the University of Heidelberg. I later obtained a PhD in Astrophysics at the University of Durham.

I'm interested in any kind of problem that requires large computational resources to understand. During my PhD, I developed new numerical methods to simulate active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in the form of radiative winds. I'm also one of the lead developers of JUNE, a one-to-one epidemiological agent-based model of England.

Lately, I'm interested in how we can leverage machine learning tools to improve the way agent-based models (ABM) are designed, calibrated, validated, and verified.
