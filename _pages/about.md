I'm a senior researcher at Macrocosm based in New York. Macrocosm uses agent-based models and machine learning tools to understand the economy as a complex system. Our aim is to build models of the economy to make the world a better place.

My overall interests are in using computational tools to understand emergent phenomena. While my main focus has been on agent-based models, I also have a special interest in Active Inference and the Julia programming language.

I was previously a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. I read Physics and Mathematics at the University of Barcelona, followed by an MSc in Physics at the University of Heidelberg. I later obtained a PhD in Astrophysics at the University of Durham. During my stay at Oxford, I focused on developing differentiable-based methods to improve the calibration of agent-based models.
